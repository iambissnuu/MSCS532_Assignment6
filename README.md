# Assignment 6: Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures

## Overview

This assignment is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Selection Algorithms
Implements two algorithms to find the k-th smallest element in an array:
- `randomized_quickselect.py`: Randomized Quickselect (expected O(n) time)
- `deterministic_median_of_medians.py`: Median of Medians (worst-case O(n) time)

### Part 2: Elementary Data Structures
Implements the following basic data structures using Python:
- `array_demo.py`: Dynamic array with insert, delete, and access
- `stack_array.py`: Stack implemented using an array
- `queue_array.py`: Queue implemented using an array
- `linked_list.py`: Singly linked list with insert, delete, and traversal
- `rooted_tree.py`: Rooted tree using linked nodes (optional part included)

### Report
- `Medians & Statistics report` : Report with analysis, complexity breakdown, use cases, and references

## How to Run the Code

Run any `.py` file using the following command in your terminal:

    python filename.py

### Example:

    python selection_algorithms/randomized_quickselect.py
    python data_structures/linked_list.py
